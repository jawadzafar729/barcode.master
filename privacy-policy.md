1. Introduction
BarcodeMaster ("we", "our", or "us") is a barcode and QR code scanning application for Android. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application. By using BarcodeMaster, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

2. Information We Collect
2.1 Information You Provide
We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use BarcodeMaster.

2.2 Camera Data
BarcodeMaster uses your device's camera solely to scan barcodes and QR codes in real time. Camera images and video frames are:

Processed entirely on your device
Never uploaded, transmitted, or stored on any external server by us
Discarded immediately after scanning is complete
2.3 Scan History (Local Storage)
Scanned barcode results (e.g., text, URLs, contact details) may be saved to a local database on your device (Room/SQLite) so you can review your scan history. This data:

Never leaves your device
Can be cleared at any time from within the app
Is not accessible to us or any third party
2.4 Automatically Collected Data
We do not directly collect analytics, crash reports, or usage statistics. However, third-party SDKs integrated into the app may collect certain non-personal data as described in Section 4.

3. Permissions Used
Permission	Purpose
CAMERA	Scan barcodes and QR codes in real time
INTERNET	Load advertisements (Google AdMob)
ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE	Check connectivity before loading ads
We request only the permissions necessary for core functionality.

4. Third-Party Services
4.1 Google AdMob
BarcodeMaster displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and use data such as:

Device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID)
Approximate location (based on IP address)
Ad interaction data
This data is governed by Google's Privacy Policy. You can opt out of personalized ads via your device's settings: Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization.

4.2 ZXing Barcode Scanner Library
We use the open-source ZXing library for barcode decoding. This library operates entirely on-device and does not collect or transmit any data.

5. Data Security
All scan data is stored locally on your device and is protected by your device's built-in security (encryption, screen lock, etc.). We do not have access to your scan history. We do not transmit your scan data over the network.

6. Data Retention
Scan history is retained locally until you delete it within the app or uninstall the application.
Camera frames are never retained — they are processed in real time and discarded.
7. Children's Privacy
BarcodeMaster is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through our app, please contact us and we will take appropriate action.

8. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including:

The right to access data held about you
The right to delete your data (by clearing scan history or uninstalling the app)
The right to opt out of personalized advertising (via device settings)
Since all user data is stored locally on your device, you retain full control over it at all times.

9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the Effective Date at the top of this document. Continued use of the app after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
